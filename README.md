Restaurant Randomizer UI README

## Description
A website that is used to randomly pick a location to eat based on user preferences and set location.  I based it off of stuff I have seen similar simple crud learning apps that I have seen online.  I have a use for it because some of my coworkers can't always decided where they want to go to get food.

## Technologies Used
HTML 5, CSS3, Bootstap 3, SASS

## Development process and problem-solving strategy
Based on my experience with the last project, I decided that I would rather focus on implementing and trying out new functionality rather than making a super clean UI.  I spent too much time during the Tic-Tac-Toe project on creating a nav and keeping to the original scope, that I didn't challenge myself at all.  This time around, while I did make sure that I met the requirements first, anything that was outside of requirements was backburnered.
