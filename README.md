Restaurant Randomizer UI README

## Description
A website that is used to randomly pick a location to eat based on user preferences and set location.  I based it off of stuff I have seen similar crud learning apps that I have seen online.  I have a use for it because some of my coworkers can't always decided where they want to go to get food.

## Development process and problem-solving strategy
Based on my experience with the last project, I decided that I would rather focus on implementing and trying out new functionality rather than making a super clean UI.  I spent too much time during the Tic-Tac-Toe project on creating a nav and keeping to the original scope, that I didn't challenge myself at all.  This time around, while I did make sure that I met the requirements first, anything that was outside of requirements was backburnered.  Because of this, I originally created the site using mockup data.  That defeated the purpose of the site, and moved away from the original vision, but it meets requirements.  After that was done, I focused on creating the API call to FourSquare.  I was able to get that up and running fairly quickly.  I was able to then implement it into my UI.

## List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
I would have made some improvements to the logic used in the code.  There are definitely things that can be made more efficient (ex. Preference / Category Logic).  If it wasn't for the project requirements, I would also rip out code that doesn't make much logically sense (aka the delete preference button). I would also spend some time on making the UI nicer.  The Google Maps iframe looks like garbage on mobile.
